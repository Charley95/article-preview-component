### What I learned

I learned different ways of working with svg icons and images.

See below the html and css code snippets for the svg:

```html
<svg class="share" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="13"><path fill="currentColor" d="M15 6.495L8.766.014V3.88H7.441C3.33 3.88 0 7.039 0 10.936v2.049l.589-.612C2.59 10.294 5.422 9.11 8.39 9.11h.375v3.867L15 6.495z"/>
</svg>
          
```
```css
.share {
    color: hsl(214, 17%, 51%);
 }
```
